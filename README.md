# VFH-obstacle-avoidance
The Vector Field Histogram (VFH) is an obstacle avoidance method which permits the detection of obstacles while steering the mobile robot toward the target simultaneously. ([Borenstein & Koren, 1991](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~motionplanning/papers/sbp_papers/integrated1/borenstein_VFHisto.pdf))

This project includes a detailed implementation of the VFH algorithm. Using this method, the mobile robot is able to detect and avoid walls in a maze and move toward a specific target.
